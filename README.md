# ClipnoteExporter
A program that exports your clipnote animations as a gif file.

This program is mostly a prototype that I managed to make in my free-time, soon I'll work on a better version soon.

Clipnote Studio (https://calcium-chan.itch.io/clipnote) is a simple animation program based on Flipnote Studio,
it already has a program that can be used to export its animations as a video file (https://meatsphere.itch.io/paperclip),
however it dos not work on my computer, and I've seen other people getting the same issues, so I made my own version of it.

Currently it only lists your animations at the GUI and exports whichever one you choos as a gif,
I plan on having .mp4 an audio support once I get to make the more complete version of it.

the code is a bit unorganized but it's the best I was able to make at the moment,
once college is off and I'm done with some personal projects it'll look a lot better.
